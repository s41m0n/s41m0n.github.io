&lt;p>It exploits both eBPF and Linux Kernel to perform Virtual Network Functions extremely fast and optimized. It is written in C++.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My contribution consists in:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>lighten the Docker image built (from 2.7 GB to 260 MB)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>extending Dynamic Monitor (Dynmon), a service to dynamically inject user eBPF code, monitor the attached network interface and export metrics&lt;/li>
&lt;li>addressing packet timestamp problem&lt;/li>
&lt;li>introducing newest kernel structures support&lt;/li>
&lt;li>optimize and extend the Firewall service for batch operations&lt;/li>
&lt;li>writing a flexible Profiler framework&lt;/li>
&lt;li>completing documentation and tests&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>Instructors can provision a set of virtual machines, properly equipped with the software required for a given lab (e.g., compilers, simulation software, etc). In addition, each student can share his remote desktop with his groupmates, enabling multiple students to complete their labs in a team.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, CrownLabs supports also instructors, who can connect to the remote desktop of the student and play directly with his environment, e.g., in case some help is required.&lt;/p>

This way, devices will save computational resources and, as a result, also battery consumption since they only connect to the node running the desired application using a light remote desktop client.&lt;/p>
