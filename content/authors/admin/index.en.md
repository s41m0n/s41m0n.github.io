Simone Magnani is a PhD student jointly at Fondazione Bruno Kessler (Povo, Italy) and University of Genova (Genova, Italy). Currently, he focuses on AI/ML-based detection system and their correlation with network traffic monitoring features. Prior to this, Simone was focussed mainly on traffic monitoring, leveraging technologies such as eBPF and contributing to open source projects. Moreover, he has been member of two cybersecurity italian teams, [CeSeNA](https://cesena.github.io) and [pwnthem0le](https://pwnthemole.github.io).

Simone is currently open for hiring. His ideal position would be as an Open Source Software Engineer mainly focusing on projects related to network traffic monitoring, service observability and virtualization. He is confident that his positive 'can-do' attitude, combined with his technical expertise, would be valuable contributions to the role.
