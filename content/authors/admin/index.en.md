Simone Magnani is a PhD student jointly at Fondazione Bruno Kessler (Povo, Italy) and University of Genova (Genova, Italy). Alongside all the academic tasks, he focuses on cyber security, cloud platforms and networking. Moreover, he has been member of two cybersecurity italian teams, [CeSeNA](https://cesena.github.io) and [pwnthem0le](https://pwnthemole.github.io), thanks to he not only had the opportunity to study and share with the other members many security issues, but he also took part in competitions (called CaptureTheFlag) fighting against other teams.

For the entire duration of its PhD study course, Simone wants to keep digging topics like cloud computing and network security, applying artificial intelligence algorithms and advanced kernel packet filtering techniques to prototype and dig out an innovative cyberattacks detection mechanism.
