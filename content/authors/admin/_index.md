Simone Magnani is a MSc student of Computer Engineering at Polytechnic of Turin. Alongside all the academic tasks, he focuses on cyber security, cloud platforms and networking. Moreover, he has been member of two cyber security italian teams, [CeSeNA](https://cesena.github.io) (ongoing) and [pwnthem0le](https://pwnthemole.github.io) (2019), thanks to he not only had the opportunity to study and share with the other members many security issues, but he also took part to competitions (called CaptureTheFlag) fighting against other teams.

After his graduation (October 2020), Simone wants to keep digging themes like cloud computing and network security by following a PhD study course in a research center, where he can focus on his goals and significantly broaden his knowledge.
