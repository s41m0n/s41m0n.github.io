This project has been realized as a Proof of Concept to demonstrate that, thanks to the latest innovative technologies like Kubernetes and VNC, it is possible to move computation from the end user device to the edge or a remote data center. This way, devices will save computational resources and, as a result, also battery consumption since they only connect to the node running the desired application using a light remote desktop client.
