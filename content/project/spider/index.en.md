[Spider](https://spider-h2020.eu/) is an European project funded by the European Union's Horizon 2020 EU Research & Innovation program. It delivers an innovative Cyber Range as a Service (CRaaS) platform that extends and combines the capabilities of existing telecommunications testbeds and cyber ranges with the most recent advances in telecommunications management and emulation, gamification and serious games training as well as economics of cybersecurity.

My contribution consists into designin an entire challenge Capture the Flag leveraging famous CVE and exploitation techniques to get control of remote 5G nodes and steal information. Finally, I also provided a Blue team challenge, which consists into performing vulnerability assessment and patching the platform in order to prevent such threats.
