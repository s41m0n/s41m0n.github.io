Born to address the PoliTo students labs problem during Covid19 pandemic, CrownLabs is a set of services that can deliver remote computing labs through a per-user virtual machine.

Instructors can provision a set of virtual machines, properly equipped with the software required for a given lab (e.g., compilers, simulation software, etc). In addition, each student can share his remote desktop with his groupmates, enabling multiple students to complete their labs in a team.

Finally, CrownLabs supports also instructors, who can connect to the remote desktop of the student and play directly with his environment, e.g., in case some help is required.
