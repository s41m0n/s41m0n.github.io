A Cooperative Editor written in C++ which allows you to create, manage and share your documents among your friends, similarly as Google Docs.

Born as a project for the System and Device programming course, it is completely written in C++ and can be deployed everywhere. It exploits the use of CRDT algorithm to ensure that all remote updates are coherently introduced in the file.
