However, in practice this is hard to achieve due to the limitations of reference software platforms, such as Kubernetes, which are designed to orchestrate cloud-native services. In this work, we complement Kubernetes with a state-of-the-art algorithm for application-aware provisioning of security services. We demonstrate that the proposed solution improves basic provisioning mechanisms, such as the default Kubernetes scheduler, in terms of Quality of Service and security guarantees for the users.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Control Plane Enabling Automated and Fully Adaptive Network Traffic Monitoring With eBPF</title><link>https://s41m0n.github.io/publication/opportunistic/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://s41m0n.github.io/publication/opportunistic/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Towards Application-Aware Provisioning of Security Services with Kubernetes</title><link>https://s41m0n.github.io/publication/netsoft22/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://s41m0n.github.io/publication/netsoft22/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Cooperative Editor</title><link>https://s41m0n.github.io/project/cooperative_editor/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 May 2020 11:09:03 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://s41m0n.github.io/project/cooperative_editor/</guid><description>&lt;p>A Cooperative Editor written in C++ which allows you to create, manage and share your documents among your friends, similarly as Google Docs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Born as a project for the System and Device programming course, it is completely written in C++ and can be deployed everywhere. It exploits the use of CRDT algorithm to ensure that all remote updates are coherently introduced in the file.&lt;/p>
