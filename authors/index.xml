Currently, he focuses on AI/ML-based detection system and their correlation with network traffic monitoring features. Prior to this, Simone was focussed mainly on traffic monitoring, leveraging technologies such as eBPF and contributing to open source projects. Moreover, he has been member of two cybersecurity italian teams,
