&lt;p>Born as a project for the System and Device programming course, it is completely written in C++ and can be deployed everywhere. It exploits the use of CRDT algorithm to ensure that all remote updates are coherently introduced in the file.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Instructors can provision a set of virtual machines, properly equipped with the software required for a given lab (e.g., compilers, simulation software, etc). In addition, each student can share his remote desktop with his groupmates, enabling multiple students to complete their labs in a team.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, CrownLabs supports also instructors, who can connect to the remote desktop of the student and play directly with his environment, e.g., in case some help is required.&lt;/p>

This way, devices will save computational resources and, as a result, also battery consumption since they only connect to the node running the desired application using a light remote desktop client.&lt;/p>
