&lt;p>The main difference with others frameworks alike, is that DeChainy has been developed to satisfy the final user (researcher, students, etc.) expectations, and ease its development. In fact, while some service like Firewall or DDoSMitigator is already embedded in the framework, users can customize their network monitoring probes, creating its own programs accessible in two different ways: using an HTTP server, or as if they were custom Python scripts, fully accessible and easy to interact with.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are plenty of features available, also concerning eBPF/XDP performance point of view.&lt;/p>
