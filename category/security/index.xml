&lt;p>The aim is to monitor network traffic in order to detect attacks like DDoS and Crypto mining. When such attacks are detected, it automatically inserts rules in the Firewall to both prevent and stop them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The framework is composed by many components which interact using standardized Rest APIs. My concern, was to develop an eBPF program to be injected and used in
&lt;a href="https://s41m0n.github.io/project/polycube/">Polycube&lt;/a> in order to analyze incoming and outgoing packets, extracting some features among them and export these values to the other components.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>eBPF has always been used for statistics and traffic redirection, so this usage is quiet uncommon, but it turned out to be an innovative approach which led to good results without altering networking perfomance so much.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In collaboration with:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Universidad Politécnica de Madrid&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fondazione Bruno Kessler&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Telefónica&lt;/li>
&lt;li>RedBorder&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

It provides both full system and single service monitoring, looking for incoming malicious HTTP requests. In fact, during such competitions, while you try to steal other participants secret information to get points, they will try to hack your system stealing yours. IDCAS detects when your system has been compromised and, while it cannot block the attack since it is prohibited in CTF, it will replay the same malicious request to all the other teams.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>IDCAS exploits the use of eBPF and XDP, monitoring the system from the bottom to the top.&lt;/p>

It provides full service monitoring, looking for incoming malicious HTTP requests. In fact, during such competitions, while you try to steal other participants secret information to get points, they will try to hack your system stealing yours. IPCAS detects when your system has been compromised and, while it prevents the attack to be successful by providing a fake flag to the attacker, it will replay the same malicious request to all the other teams.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>IPCAS exploits mitmproxy, monitoring and forwarding request to the specified service.&lt;/p>
